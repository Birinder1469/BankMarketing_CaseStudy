# Bank Marketing Case Study

The data set from UC Irvineâ€™s Machine Learning Repository [Dataset url](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) includes direct marketing campaigns (i.e. phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (indicated in the y variable). The task is to create a model that will help this banking institution determine, in advance, clients who will be receptive to such marketing campaigns. Clearly state the metric used for this problem.
