# Bank Marketing Case Study

The data set from UC Irvineâ€™s Machine Learning Repository [Dataset url](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) includes direct marketing campaigns (i.e. phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (indicated in the y variable). The task is to create a model that will help this banking institution determine, in advance, clients who will be receptive to such marketing campaigns. Clearly state the metric used for this problem.

The processing was done in Google colab notebooks. The package versions are listed in the requirements.txt file.

Three notebooks listed below contain end to end implentation.
